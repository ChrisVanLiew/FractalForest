# FractalForest

This is the updated version of the [FractalForest](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fractal-forest.75850/) plugin that works with Java 16 and Minecraft 1.17+. Note that this fork will be discontinued if the original author updates the plugin.

**Note: Support for the Lands plugin has been dropped since the LandsProtection.java class was having issues with the LandsAPI dependency. If anyone wants to take a shot at fixing it, I'll take a look and merge it to master if it works!**
